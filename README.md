# Timfrastructure

Holds [infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code) (mostly [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), and some [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)) for my cloud infrastructure (most of it with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)).

**A lot of this is under construction at present.** Use at your own risk!

Ideas and contributions welcome. Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/tdmalone/timfrastructure/issues/new), or for security issues contact me at [security@tm.id.au](mailto:security@tm.id.au).
